Location where Xcode default code snippets live:
./Library/Xcode/PrivatePlugIns/IDECodeSnippetLibrary.ideplugin/Contents/Resources/SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets

Location where xCode looks for user code snippets:
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets

Code snippets are XML Plists.  The system .codesnippets file is a long plist with an array of snippets inside while the user snippets are one snippet per file.


Modifying included system snippets
   Dump each snippet into its own .snippet file (xml plist)
   Add this to the snippet dictionary to make it a user snippet:
   		<key>IDECodeSnippetUserSnippet</key>
		<true/>
   Add this to the snipped dictionary to make it the top choice for its particular completion; this ensures that the user snippet will be chosen by default
        <key>IDECodeSnippetRelativePriority</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
   Optionally delete the system snippet (Xcode reinstallation will also reinstall the whole snippet file, so this isn't too dangerous)
